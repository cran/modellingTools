Description: Useful functions for performing common
    data analysis tasks that I could not find in other packages. For
    example, flexible functions for discretizing ("binning") continuous
    variables are included, since this is a common technique used in
    industry that is not well appreciated in academia. See the vignette
    for a more detailed high-level explanation, or the documentation
    for full details.
